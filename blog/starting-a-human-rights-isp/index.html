class=zola-anchor href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>This article was originally published on emeraldonion.org in 2017 and has been revamped in 2024. In addition, in 2018, yawnbox <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs6a1i4Owic" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>spoke at DEF CON 26</a> (YouTube link) about creating Emerald Onion. Please be aware that because Emerald Onion is a US-based not-for-profit, this guide is centered on US laws and programs.<p>Part of Emerald Onion’s mission is to share our actions in detail in order to help educate others who wish to create their own human-rights focused transit internet service provider. We have a vision that entails many trusted nonprofits setting up and operating long-term, stable, and fast Tor routing operations. Below you will find a high level overview of tasks that we needed to complete in order to create Emerald Onion. As we develop, we will publish greater detail behind each action by linking to a related blog post or external resource.<p>To date, we are aware of at least four human rights ISPs that have formed in part because of Emerald Onion's example. We are always excited to provide guidance to those interested.<h1 id=step-by-step>Step-by-step<a aria-label="Anchor link for: step-by-step" class=zola-anchor href=#step-by-step>#</a></h1><h2 id=founding>Founding<a aria-label="Anchor link for: founding" class=zola-anchor href=#founding>#</a></h2><ol><li><p>Invite meaningful and trusted people for the board of directors, executive leadership, and advisory board.</p><li><p>Create a mission and vision statements, and organizational goals.</p><li><p>Setup a password manager for generating and documenting organizational passwords.</p><li><p>Purchase a domain name, setup the website, and setup social media accounts.</p><li><p>Setup Microsoft hosted email service for admin@ and abuse@ inboxes.

We presume because Google wants to be able to perform their own conotrols over what comes into these email addresses. It's critical for Tor relay operators to have access to these email addresses, and use them to their fullest extent. If you're up to the challenge, self-hosted email can work great (with proper SPF, DMARC, DKIM, and DNSSEC/DANE configurations) with open source solutions such as <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://mailcow.email target=_blank>MailCow</a>.<ol start=6><li>Setup a UPS Store mailbox for registration (your primary “place of business” address) and find Registered Agent services for your registered agent.

Be sure to use your Registered Agents and also your mail receiving or mail forwarding service as your "place of business", unless of course you have a physical office somewhere.</p></ol><p>2024 note: Even before this step, but certainly after, be sure to conduct B2B communications with your business email and phone number.<ol start=9><li>Begin contacting local data center service providers and upstream internet service providers that offer their services in said data center.</ol><p>2024 notes:<ul><li><p>Picking up "the language" of data centers and internet service providers has its own learning curve. First and foremost, you need data center co-location: a place to rack your servers and network gear. Colo service requests include but are not limited to, the amount of physical "U space" that you need for your servers, like a half-rack, quarter-rack, or shared space. We disadvise shared rack space because Tor relays should be behind lock and key. Colo requests also need to know how much power in amps you expect to need. Secondly, you need IP transit, which is your organization's general internet access. Some colo providers offer their own "mixed network" transit, which means they blend multiple Tier-1 ISPs together to offer cheaper transit. Otherwise, you need to seek out Tier-1 or Tier-2 transit ISPs, and the cheaper the better. Tor relays can saturate bandwidth easily, so it may be important to seek "unmetered" or "fully commited" 1Gbps or 10Gbps ports. Otherwise, "95th percentile" 10Gbps will be cheaper and allow you to burst up to 10Gbps. Getting your own IP transit, in other words not provided by the colo provider, may require "cross connects", which usually cost money. A cross-connect is simply the service of the data center seting up then maintaining the physical copper or fiber connection from your rack to your upstream ISP. Lastly, you may need, and should seek out, access to <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://emeraldonion.org/blog/internet-exchange-points-in-the-united-states/ target=_blank>Internet Exchange Points</a> (IXP). Expect cross-connects to IXPs, but some colo providers may provide free cross-connects to local IXPs, be sure to ask about free or reduced cross-connects.</p><li><p>Again and again, data center and transit ISPs have extremely little empathy for not-for-profits like Emerald Onion. They do not care that we are 100% volunteer run and 100% donation-based. They certainly don't care about Tor when you are bringing your own ASN and IP space. The internet infrastructure ecosystem is for-profit.</p><li><p>To date, we've found that Huricane Electric's <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.he.net/tour/fremont2.html target=_blank>FMT2 datacenter</a> is the cheapest unmetered 10Gbps transit that we can find. We have also found many regional co-ops exist, but rarely do they support 10Gbps transit, or more. Most critically, it's important to find solutions that minimize recurring fees. One-time setup fees, for things like cross-connects, are the kinds of things to ask for, or kindly request to waive or reduce recurring costs.</p><li><p>Are you going to have your own BGP-capable edge router? and will you announce your own ASN and IP space to the rest of the internet? If not, and you want your upsteam ISP to do this for you, then you need to be clear about this in your service request. You'll need to ask them for a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.cidr.eu/en/letter-of-authorization target=_blank>Letter of Authorization</a>.</p><li><p>Be mindful about the opportunities that <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://emeraldonion.org/blog/internet-exchange-points-in-the-united-states/ target=_blank>IXPs provide</a>.</p></ul><ol start=10><li><p>Apply for <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin target=_blank>Employer Identification Number</a> (EIN/TIN) from IRS, even without paid employees.</p><li><p>Apply for a business bank account with a local nonprofit credit union and obtain debit cards.</p><li><p>Apply for 501(c)3 status using the 1023-EZ (<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/emeraldonion/emeraldonion.github.io/blob/master/files/EO_IRS_1023EZ.pdf target=_blank>See our 2017 1023-EZ</a>).</p></ol><h2 id=establishing>Establishing<a aria-label="Anchor link for: establishing" class=zola-anchor href=#establishing>#</a></h2><ol start=13><li>Once your Charity status has been granted by the IRS, sign up the org for <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.paypal.com/us/non-profit/fundraising/fundraising-online target=_blank>PayPal’s Nonprofit services</a>.</ol><p>2024 note: Paypal has been instrumental for us to receive funding. Both direct from people, but also to fasciliate corporate donations. Paypal waives all fees for 501(c)(3) not-for-profits, meaning we get 100% of a person's donation. One weird potentially odd thing about this setup is that Paypal's not-for-profit org is the entity that people give a donation to, and that org simply forwards 100% of the donation to Emerald Onion. To donation/tax receipts will appear to be Paypal.<ol start=14><li>Apply for nonprofit startup grants when available.</ol><p>2024 note: We were very fortunate to be provided a $5,000 startup grant by the then TorServers.net. We would not have been able to launch without this initial funding.<ol start=15><li>Setup a phone call with chosen legal representation to discuss optional support. <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.eff.org/about/contact target=_blank>The EFF</a> may be an option.

Feel free to start with our free <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://emeraldonion.org/legal/ target=_blank>Legal FAQ</a>. If needing paid legal support, request a “Form Engagement Letter” from legal representation.</ol><p>2024 note: Our Legal FAQ has been a foundational element for our sustained legal safety.

We did not use our Registered Agent address with our POC records since we want to minimize who has access to government legal demands.<ol start=20><li>Setup insurance provider(s) needed for data center co-location service, including “commercial general liability”, “business property protection”, and “professional liability” insurance.</ol><p>2024 note: We use <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.thehartford.com/business-insurance-landing-page target=_blank>The Hardtford</a>, and have since day one.<ol start=21><li><p>Finalize negotiating all fees with your data center and IP transit service (upstream ISP) providers and then sign contracts.

Once you have your upstream ISP-provided IP addresses, now you can apply for your own ASN and your own IP space.</p><li><p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/request/ target=_blank>Apply to ARIN</a> (or your RIR) for your organization's <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/asn/ target=_blank>Autonomous Systems Number</a> (ASN) and then an /48 or /32 IPv6 block. It's important to get IP space in this order. Understand <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.arin.net/participate/policy/nrpm/#4-10-dedicated-ipv4-allocation-to-facilitate-ipv6-deployment target=_blank>ARIN's 4.10 rule</a> for obtaining a free /24 IPv4 block. Once you have obtained an ASN and IPv6 block, apply for a free /24 IPv4 block using ARIN's 4.10 rule.</p></ol><p>2024 note: Emerald Onion pays an annual fee of $250 for our ASN and $250 for our /48 IPv6 block. Back in 2017, we applied for our first 4.10 IPv4 block with success by explaining how Tor needs more IPv6 relays in order to eventually allow IPv6-only relays. So in order to facilitate more IPv6 in the Tor network, operators such as Emerald Onion needs "immediate" access to an IPv4 block. A few years later, since Emerald Onion now has multiple POPs, we successfully obtained a second /24 IPv4 block using the same 4.10 rule. So, our IPv4 blocks are free and perpetual.<ul><li>Example: our <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/emeraldonion/emeraldonion.github.io/blob/master/images/ARIN-ASN-Request.png target=_blank>ASN request</a><li>Example: our <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/emeraldonion/emeraldonion.github.io/blob/master/images/ARIN-IPv6-request.png target=_blank>IPv6 request</a><li>Example: our <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/emeraldonion/emeraldonion.github.io/blob/master/images/ARIN-IPv4-Request.png target=_blank>IPv4 request</a></ul><h2 id=deploying>Deploying<a aria-label="Anchor link for: deploying" class=zola-anchor href=#deploying>#</a></h2><ol start=23><li><p>Publish a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://emeraldonion.org/donate/ target=_blank>donation page</a>, legal FAQ, mission, and vision statements on the website.</p><li><p>Deploy your gear in your new data center.
