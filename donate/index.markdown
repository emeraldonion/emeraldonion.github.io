Emerald Onion would not exist without the generosity of people, including the people behind Emerald Onion who are all volunteers. Grants and donations make up 100% of our income, and we would sincerely welcome your help. Being a tax-deductible nonprofit, we depend on grants and donations for maintaining and building privacy infrastructure.
