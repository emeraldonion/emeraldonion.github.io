# Giving Tuesday, 2021:

_Tier 1_: If you donate $10 or more, we will mail you 3 Emerald Onion stickers from Seattle.
_Tier 2_: If you donate $100 of more, we will allow you naming rights to a new, long-term middle relay (max: 40 middle relays, first come, first serve).

If your company does donation matching and you donate $50, the total donation will be $100, so we will allow you to name a new middle relay. If you donate $100 and your company matches for a total of $200, we will allow you to name 2 new middle relays, etc.

For either donation tier, forward us your donation confirmation email to donations(at)emeraldonion.org along with your complete mailing address. If you donate $100 or more, please give us a name for the new middle relay. Please note: Relay names must be 1 to 19 characters in length, only letters and numbers (a-zA-Z0-9), and no spaces or special characters. This is a limitation in the tor specification.

Please contact us with any questions.

As of Q4 2021, all of Emerald Onion's Tor relays are hosted in downtown Seattle in the Westin data center. All relays are dual-stack IPv6/v4, run on Emerald Onion's owned and operated AMD Epyc (7402P) hardware, and run either HardenedBSD 13 or Ubuntu 20.04 server.
