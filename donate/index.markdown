Emerald Onion has been built from the ground up to function as a dedicated transit ISP and Tor exit router operator. Our staff has a combined 35+ years in the management of data center operations. Being a nonprofit, we depend on grants and donations for maintaining and building out our infrastructure. Today, we are launching a new initiative that provides other human rights defenders a new way to contribute to the Tor network.

With a one-time, tax-deductible donation, you can fund one (or more) Emerald Onion-managed Tor exit relay. The donation amounts are based on near wholesale pricing that Emerald Onion negotiates with our internet providers. Please contact us [via email](mailto:admin@emeraldonion.org) before donating to assure we set up new relays for you.


# Your Donation Benefits




## ✔️Fully managed


We receive abuse complaints directly, and we respond to every complaint within 72 hours with the support of dedicated legal counsel. We are able to do this because we have our own [ASN](https://whois.arin.net/rest/asn/AS396507.html) and direct-allocation [IP scopes](https://whois.arin.net/rest/org/EO-95/nets) from ARIN.


## ✔️Connectivity


We are connected to the [Seattle Internet Exchange](https://www.seattleix.net/) via BGP with direct connections to nearly [200 members](https://emeraldonion.org/bgp/). This creates a very short exit path to those services.


## ✔️Dual-stack addressing


Our Tor relays get their own static IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.


## ✔️Unmetered bandwidth


We have no bandwidth caps with the upstream ISPs that we contract with.


## ✔️Unfiltered access


Our Tor relays are not "reduced" in any way. We transit all Tor traffic from all 65,535 ports.


# Your Donation Options


You can choose the names of the relay, which will show up in DNS (name.emeraldonion.org) and in Tor Project's [Atlas](https://atlas.torproject.org/#top10). If you decide to make any of these donations anonymously, either via cash, money order, or zcash, we will know what to do with your gift. 


## 50 Mbps


For a one-time donation of $300, Emerald Onion will deploy and manage a single 50 Mbps Tor relay for one year.


## 100 Mbps


For a one-time donation of $600, Emerald Onion will deploy and manage a single 100 Mbps Tor relay for one year.


## 1 Gbps


For a one-time donation of $6,000, Emerald Onion will deploy and manage two 500 Mbps Tor relays for one year.


## 10 Gbps


For a one-time donation of $30,000, Emerald Onion will deploy and manage ten 1 Gbps Tor relays for one year split between two geographically-diverse locations.


## 20 Gbps


For a one-time donation of $250,000, Emerald Onion will deploy and manage twenty 1 Gbps Tor relays for five years split between four geographically-diverse locations.

Emerald Onion would not exist without the generosity of people, including the people behind Emerald Onion who are all volunteers. Grants and donations make up 100% of our income, and we would sincerely welcome your help.
