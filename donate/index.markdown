Emerald Onion would not exist without the generosity of people, including the people behind Emerald Onion who are all volunteers. Grants and donations make up 100% of our income, and we would sincerely welcome your help. Being a tax-deductible nonprofit, we depend on grants and donations for deploying and maintaining privacy infrastructure.

If you are interested in donating time or IPv4 space, or volunteering, please contact us via Signal (+1-206-739-3390), Wire (EmeraldOnion), or Email (donations at emeraldonion.org) with questions.
