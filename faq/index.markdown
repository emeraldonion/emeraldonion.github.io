# What is Emerald Onion?


Emerald Onion is a Washington State-based not-for-profit corporation and encrypted transit internet service provider. Emerald Onion works to protect privacy, anonymity, access to information, and free speech online. To further that mission, we operate high-capacity, fully open Tor exit routers with connectivity to the [Seattle Internet Exchange](https://www.seattleix.net/).

By supporting transit of encrypted traffic, Emerald Onion protects the human rights and civil liberties of those subjected to censorship and surveillance. By implementing emerging privacy and anonymity-focused services, Emerald Onion promotes the development and normalization of those technologies. Through publishing, consulting, and advocacy, Emerald Onion furthers academic research and awareness for the development of new, privacy-preserving techniques.


# What is Tor and Why Does Emerald Onion Run Tor Exit Routers?


Tor is a research project [funded by](https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors.html.en) a multitude of nonprofits, NGOs, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of State. Its primary goal is to provide people in hostile environments with unsurveilled and uncensored access to the Internet. Running Tor exit routers is our way of supporting people that have something important to read or say and undermining global mass surveillance by oppressive regimes.
