# Internal Policies & Procedures


This is a place to document our organizational and technical policies & procedures. Each policy will need to be expanded and created into its own page at some point and some will even be published in blog posts.


## Organizational Policies & Procedures





 	
  * Publish as much as security and privacy permits. It is important for the community to learn from how we do things and it also provides transparency to our process. The easiest way to accomplish this is through the use of blog posts.

 	
  * Advisor recruiting policy: 1. Identify potential advisor. 2. Make sure their views and goals align with our mission. 3. Have them write aÂ paragraph about their history in around privacy and/or security within the area in which they will be assisting. Have them decide if they want to only be listed as a pseudonym or both their name & pseudonym. 4. Present that to the existing list of Advisors and Board Members in the Signal group for feedback. Having them meet some advisors or board members beforehand can also really help, but shouldn't be used in lieu of the feedback request in Signal. 5. Wait 24-hours for feedback. 6. Extend the offer to the resource and update the website.




## Technical Policies & Procedures





 	
  * Data encryption at rest is required on all servers.

 	
  * Do not use shared accounts.
