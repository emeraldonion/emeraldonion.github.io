Peering with Emerald Onion is an excellent way to contribute to the Tor network! We strongly recommend peering with us if you're a member of the Seattle Internet Exchange or the Fremont Cabal Internet Exchange.

We have an open peering policy, and in some circumstances, we are willing to peer over tunnels. All we ask is that:

 	
  * Do not point default or static routes at Emerald Onion without a signed written agreement.

 	
  * Keep your contact information up-to-date (preferably in PeeringDB).


If you're interested, you may contact peering (at) emeraldonion.org and you can view our information in PeeringDB here:
